# Learn-To-Code-In-Ten-Days
This is my first repository that I made and it is a coding class that last ten days ( look at the name )

## Example: hello.py

Run the example hello script:

```bash
python3 hello.py
# or, after making it executable:
./hello.py
```


## hello.py (interactive)

`hello.py` prompts you for a name and a count, then prints "<name> is cool" that many times.

Usage:

```bash
# Run and answer the prompts:
python3 hello.py

# Or provide input non-interactively (example):
printf "Sid\n5\n" | python3 hello.py
```

Notes:

- Default name: `sid` (press Enter to accept).
- Default count: `5` (press Enter to accept).
